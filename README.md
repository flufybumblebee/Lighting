# Tessellation
Implements tessellation on models that use triangles
Feel free to use this code any way you like so long as you acknowledge any legal requirements in chili's licence.
The basic framework is all chili's. You can always ask if you need confirmation which parts are mine.

this works best with models that use equalateral triangles such as the icosahedron.

there are two different independent cameras you can use and set seperately press ENTER/RETURN to swap between

camera position:

Z+ Axis = R
Z- Axis = F
X- Axis = Left  Arrow Key
X+ Axis = Right Arrow Key
Y+ Axis = Up    Arrow Key
Y- Axis = Down  Arrow Key

camera lookAt:

Z+ Axis = B
Z- Axis = N
X- Axis = Z
X+ Axis = X
Y+ Axis = C
Y- Axis = V

model rotation:

Z+ Axis = Q
Z- Axis = A
X- Axis = W
X+ Axis = S
Y+ Axis = E
Y- Axis = D
